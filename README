word_frequency.py is a module that generates a histogram of word frequencies 
in a given document.

word_frequency.py can be run as a program that takes in a single argument,
a text file to parse, and outputs a list of words found and their frequencies

usage:
python word_frequency.py sampletext.txt

This module will be integrated into word_histogram, which takes in multiple input files,
and performs a cumulative threaded word frequency diagram. 






This repository includes related basic unit tests, which can be run as:

python word_frequency_testing.py
