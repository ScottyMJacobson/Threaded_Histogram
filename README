A module, word_frequency, that generates a histogram of word frequencies in a given document, 

This module will be integrated into word_histogram, which takes in multiple input files,
and performs a cumulative threaded word frequency diagram. 


This repository includes related basic unit tests, which can be run as:
python word_frequency_testing.py
